To-do:

**3D:**

  - finish up wk5
  - wk6
  - _blockouts_ for final scenes


# March 24 - Thursday

3D class in the afternoon. Need to complete as much of it's work as possible during.
Afterwards, I'm going to finish up wk5's stuff and do wk 6's stuff, and then start blockouts as a bonus thing.


# March 23 - Wednesday

3D class tomorrow. I need to get caught up with work.
I'm behind on work from weeks 5 & 6, and need to complete that before continuing with this week's (8) work.

**plans:**

 ~~Rewatch wk5 Animation lecture  (1hr)~~  _Complete._

 ~~Complete Wk5 class   (2-4hr)~~ _Main section Complete._

 Blockout 2x 3D scenes   (2hr)
 
 And that will likely be all I can do today.
---------------------------

**End of day note:** Right, that went alright. I got *most* of  the wk5 animation work done,, and I'm sure I can complete the rest tomorrow morning. I unfortunately didn't get started on my blockouts because I was procrastinating. This is fine though.
 Hopefully I don't sleep in tomorrow morning..!
