To-do:
**3D:**
  - wk5
  - wk6
  - _blockouts_ for final scenes

# March 23 - Wednesday
3D class tomorrow. I need to get caught up with work.
I'm behind on work from weeks 5 & 6, and need to complete that before continuing with this week's (8) work.

** - plans: -**
 Rewatch wk5 Animation lecture  (1hr)
 Complete Wk5 class   (2-4hr)
 Blockout 2x 3D scenes   (2hr)
 
 And that will likely be all I can do today.
